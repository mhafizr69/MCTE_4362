Note for industrial sharing session by Dr.Afnizanfaizal Abdullah, Chief Technology Officer, AERODYNE GROUP.

UAV & Remote Sensing (Future Prospect)

- intro, application of AI, and future career

Drone

1) Drone atonomy as made in week 5 slide

- aerodyne does comm using RF
- due to cellular bottleneck in certain area
- Options for remote sensing. UAV, aerial (plane), Satelite
- Satelite prone to weather (cloud)
- Plane get more visible data > satelite
- UAV less area but unmanned.
- Depending on application, certain method are advantageuos 

2) Why use drone for remote sensing

AI
- Industry are moving towards AI
- AI = "Machine / Computers developed (being programmed) to *IMMITATE* natural behaviours"
- More on code, not hardware. No code, fail to immitate.
- Code important
- AI immitates human's senses via machine learning.

AI application.
> Vision AI - Differentiate objects seen by camera.
> Robotics
> Planning, Scheduling, Optimization
> Expert Systems - Law Jurisdiction
> Speech - Speech to Text or vice versa
> Natural Language Processing - Knowing the sentiment behind a speech
> Machine Learning - Deep learning & Predictive Analysis

Remote monitoring/inspection.
Use for fully autonomous drone.

3) Possible Career

Expertise that can be a value to a company.

Data analysis.
Process Data of sensors and bring it to platform.

3D model construction. Point cloud from image. 2D to 3D. create mesh then generate to CAD data.

Create digital environment. 3D Environment. Able to simulate of actual operations.
Give more insights on environment created.

Computer science and programming.

QnA.

1) Aerodyne are developing VSLAM

2) Start AI

Solid knowledge on mathematics.
visual basic
relate math with code
math + code skill

understand basic data structure
- sorting

math + code + data structure + data process

study code
Supportive community

3) Aerodyne not drone anymore, but data

4) Basic requirement to join aerodyne.
- Understand department in aerodyne
- Engine and science
- understanding the client from the engineering perspective,
- UAV piloting, experience in operating drone.
- Special project dept., MCU expertise. nested drone.
- Core value important.
- 3D expertise.
