## Week 2: Controllers

Controllers are a fundamental part of control engineering and used in all complex control systems. It controls all the inputs and outputs of a system.

A few types of controllers:

- Microcontroller (MCU)
- Single-Board Computer (SBC)
- Edge AI
- Flight controller
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
