## Week 2: Controllers

Controllers are a fundamental part of control engineering and used in all complex control systems. It controls all the inputs and outputs of a system.

A few types of controllers:

- Microcontroller (MCU)
- Single-Board Computer (SBC)
- Edge AI
- Flight controller
- Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)

## Week 3: Unmanned Grounded Vehicle (UGV)

An unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is a vehicle that operates while in contact with the ground and without an onboard human presence. UGVs can be used for many applications where it may be inconvenient, dangerous, or impossible to have a human operator present. Generally, the vehicle will have a set of sensors to observe the environment, and will either autonomously make decisions about its behavior or pass the information to a human operator at a different location who will control the vehicle through teleoperation.

## Week 4: Sensors - Perception

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.

## Week 5: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes adding a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the UAV. The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention.

## Week 6: Locomotion

Robot locomotion is the collective name for the various methods that robots use to transport themselves from place to place.

The robot’s locomotion system is an important aspect of the mobile robot design and it depends not only on the medium in which the robot moves (on the Earth’s surface, under water, in the air, etc.) but also on technical criteria such as maneuverability, controllability, terrain conditions, efficiency, stability, and so on.

Locomotion problems are solved by understanding the mechanism and kinematics, dynamics, and control theory.

Depending on it, robots can mainly walk, roll, jump, run, slide, skate, swim, and fly. According to their locomotion system, mobile robots can be classified into the following major categories:


1. Stationary (arm/manipulator)
2. Land-based

    - Wheeled mobile robot (WMR)
    - Walking (or legged) mobile robot
    - Tracked slip/skid locomotion
    - Hybrid

3. Air-based
4. Water-based
5. Other
